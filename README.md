# Vigenere-Cipher-Python

This is a source code of Vignere Cipher. I'm using string module from python and make it to a dictionary in file ordo.py.
Then using that dictionary I'm changing the ord value that I set myself into the Vigenere formula with modula 94 cause the items in the dictionary are 94.
There may be some errors.
